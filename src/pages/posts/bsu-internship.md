## Introduction

In July 2022, I participated in a biologist intern role at Belarusian State University in Minsk, Belarus. The primary focus was on conducting eco-diversity research, specifically analyzing environmental data to assess biodiversity in various ecological zones.

## Progress

### Data Collection

The internship involved extensive fieldwork where I collected various specimens of wildlife plants and bugs. This data collection was crucial for developing a comprehensive understanding of the local biodiversity.

### Classification and Analysis

Using traditional methods, I classified the collected specimens. However, the classical approach was time-consuming and required manual identification, limiting the scale of the study. To overcome this challenge, I proposed integrating AI technology to expedite the classification process, which was approved by the research team.

## Results

The integration of AI technology with traditional ecological research methods not only expedited the data analysis process but also introduced a novel approach to biodiversity studies at the university. The results had no significance, since that was an educational project, but the potential of AI in ecological research was evident.

## Technology Learned/Used

Throughout this internship, I expanded my skills in:

- **Patience and Attention to Detail** in collecting and classifying specimens
- **AI Image Recognition** to accelerate species classification

## Conclusion

This internship at Belarusian State University was an example of the ancient approaches to research. However, the integration of AI technology showcased the potential for modernizing ecological studies and enhancing the efficiency of biodiversity research. The main lesson learned was not to be afraid to propose innovative solutions to traditional problems. Even if first attempts fail, the experience gained is invaluable.
