## Introduction

From January to February 2022, I participated remotely in the Neurohack Hackathon hosted by DemoDementia. The event was dedicated to advancing research in dementia through the use of computational methods focusing on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).

## Progress

In that hackathon I helped other team members with analysis of the particular genes and their association with dementia. Also I helped with the manuscript writing. However, I was far from main contributions.

## Results

Our efforts culminated in the publication of a paper that details our findings and methodologies used during the hackathon. This paper contributes to the broader scientific community's understanding of the genetic factors associated with dementia.

## Technology Learned/Used

During this hackathon, I enhanced my skills in:

- **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)** for identifying genetic variants associated with diseases

## Conclusion

Participating in the Neurohack Hackathon was an enriching experience that not only broadened my understanding of genetic research in dementia but also demonstrated the power of computational tools in addressing complex biological questions.
