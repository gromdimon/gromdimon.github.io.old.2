## Introduction

In October 2022, I participated remotely in the BCM_HGSC Hackathon, where I focused on developing and optimizing `MetScale`, an open-source tool for querying genomic databases.

## Progress

### Initial Setup

My initial task was to understand the existing codebase and identify potential areas for optimization. The tool was initially set up for basic data retrieval but required enhancements for efficiency and scalability.

### Code Optimization

I restructured the Python code to improve its performance and maintainability. This included refining the database queries and integrating more robust error handling mechanisms.

### Documentation and Testing

Using Jupyter Notebooks, I documented the entire process, providing clear examples and instructions for future users. I also developed test cases to ensure the tool's reliability.

## Results

The optimization efforts resulted in a significant improvement in query execution times and overall data handling. The tool now supports more complex queries and can handle larger datasets efficiently. [Explore the final tool and its capabilities here.](https://github.com/signaturescience/metscale)

## Technology Learned/Used

This project allowed me to deepen my expertise in several areas:

- **Python** for backend development
- **SQLite** for efficient data management
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for documentation and presentation

## Conclusion

The BCM_HGSC Hackathon was a valuable experience in applying practical coding skills to real-world genomic research challenges. The enhancements made to the MetScale tool not only improved its performance but also contributed to its potential application in genomic studies.
